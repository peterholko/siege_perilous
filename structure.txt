Structure Revamp

1. Only 1 builder at a time per structure (too difficult to implement multiple with event based system)
2. Progress should pause if builder is interrupted
3. Progress needs to be queryable

Implementation:

--- Phases ---
1. Create Foundation 

2. Build (while state == founded)
  Set start time = current tick
  Set end time = current tick + build time

3. Cancel / Pause
  Set state to paused ? (not sure if needed)
  Set progress = (current tick - end time) / build time
  
4. Build (while state == progressing) 
  Set start time = current tick
  Set end time = current tick + (build time * (1 - progress))
