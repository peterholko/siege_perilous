---Resources---
Prospect (or Survey) action & skill needed to find resources
Prospecting uncovers resources globally (vs for the player only) 
Prospecting a tile will uncover new resources
Max prospecting skill will uncover all tile resources
Higher prospecting skill level required for higher level resources
No random element in initial prospecting version
Explore adding a random level into prospecting

 XXX Allow Enhancing of current find
 XXX Gain prospecting points by prospecting
 XXX Spend the points on enhancing existing finds
 XXX Allow villagers to prospect to generate prospecting points
 XXX Upgraded resource structure (mine level 2 allows new resources to be found)
 XXX Random chance at bonus resource B from mining resource A 
 XXX Some resources cannot be gathered directly, only indirectly as bonus resource?

Design requirements:
1. Player to actively go out and search for resources
2. Do not require players to move their village
3. Time and items required to prospect
4. Require higher level prospecting to reveal all resources
5. Require upgraded resource structures to access all resources

---Examples---
Terrain: Hills Plains
Potential Resources: All Ore, All Stone, All Gems
Requires: Picks + Time
Generated Resources: 
* Valleyrun Copper Ore / Abundant
* Stronghold Mithril Ore / Poor
* Smoldering Opal / Poor

Mining will grant chance to return all ore types at the same time on the tile.
