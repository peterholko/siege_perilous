Stamina: Stamina governs how long players can swing tools and weapons, as well as sprint. It is easier to regenerate Stamina by 
standing still rather than moving, since it regenerates in large chunks while standing still, and slowly over time if players are moving.

Hunger: Hunger is just hunger, players require food to live in this game, or else you will be knocked out repeatedly until you get food. Hunger level drop speed can be adjusted in server settings/solo play settings.

Focus: Focus lets player characters stay awake and not be knocked out, as well as casting spells. Each spell uses some focus to cast. Players can regenerate their focus by sleeping in a bedroll, canopy or bed.

Weight: Weight is the stat that determines how much a player character can carry. The weight of armor also takes up weight in the inventory as well. After going over the weight limit, the player cannot sprint and will move slower and slower the more they pick up over their weight limit.

Thirst: Thirst determines the liquid level in the player's survival stats. Typically this is restored by diving into a river or going into shallow water and pressing E to drink water (The game never tells the player this.). The other thing to do is get a container (the first container to be made is a Glass Bottle) that can be filled with water and drank from for a portable water source.S
