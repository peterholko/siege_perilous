Stamina: Stamina governs how long players can swing tools and weapons, as well as sprint. It is easier to regenerate Stamina by 
standing still rather than moving, since it regenerates in large chunks while standing still, and slowly over time if players are moving.

Hunger: Hunger is just hunger, players require food to live in this game, or else you will be knocked out repeatedly until you get food. Hunger level drop speed can be adjusted in server settings/solo play settings.

Focus: Focus lets player characters stay awake and not be knocked out, as well as casting spells. Each spell uses some focus to cast. Players can regenerate their focus by sleeping in a bedroll, canopy or bed.

Weight: Weight is the stat that determines how much a player character can carry. The weight of armor also takes up weight in the inventory as well. After going over the weight limit, the player cannot sprint and will move slower and slower the more they pick up over their weight limit.

Thirst: Thirst determines the liquid level in the player's survival stats. Typically this is restored by diving into a river or going into shallow water and pressing E to drink water (The game never tells the player this.). The other thing to do is get a container (the first container to be made is a Glass Bottle) that can be filled with water and drank from for a portable water source.S

*** Tools required ***


Ranger ideas:
From hidden state, first precise attack stuns, followed by quick or fierce attacks

Chance to detect hidden units much greater if moving across LOS instead of entering LOS




*** Night time structure ***

Day -> Twilight -> Night  -> Twilight

Focus increases by 1 per tick during Day
Focus increases by 2 per tick during Twilight
Focus increases by 4 per tick during Night




*** Push Obj Info ***

Option A)
1. a) Store obj:info call into cache table
   b) Store / keep track of client side obj info panel open for player

2. Add process to check every X seconds if new data must be pushed to client 

3. Compare new obj:info data to cache table obj:info and push to client


Option B)

Changes to check for observers

Obj being observed:
1. Obj base changes except for hunger, thirst, focus
2. Obj attrs changes
3. Item base changes
4. Skill changes
5. Effect changes

 - If villager:
   6. Villager changes
  
 - If npc:
   7. NPC changes

Item being observed:
1. Item base changes
2. Item attrs changes


Tile being observed:
1. Map changes (none possible right now)
2. Encounter wildness changes

<<<<<<< HEAD
Tax collector:

1. Travels from empire to player's location
2. Demands X gold from player
3. Waits for player to transfer X head tax and Y property tax 
4. While waiting he stops and "audits" villagers.
5. While waiting he takes food and water and shelter from the player or villagers
6. After a sometime he decides to take any items of value.  (If the player has very little of value, he deems the settlement wretchedly poor and leaves)

Hero creation:

*Warrior

*Ranger

*Mage

Basic Workshop upgrades go Blacksmith, Mason, alchemist.  Ensures the player can make basic items.

Magical recipes have limited use.

Villagers young, middle age, old, ancient.  (Age leads to lower physical attrs and higher int and higher skill)

Mining -> Gems/Dust
Stone cutting -> Gems/Dust
Woodcutting -> Herbs

Gems - full sockets of items (permanent bonus)
Dust - enchants items, temporary 

Experimenting:

1. Unlock special recipes by experimenting in the crafting structures.  The experiment action will randomly combine the resources in the structure to discover the special recipe.  Not sure now???

Experimenting Results:
1. Unlock recipes
2. Improve quality of recipe 

Each structure will have an Experiment Panel which will have a primary
item slot and "other X slots" (increases with the structure tier)

The primary item slot will define which recipe class to focus the experimentation on.

Examples
--------

Structure: Blacksmith Level 1
Primary Slot: Copper Training Axe

Other Slots (2): Copper Ingot (25) & Maple Timber (15)

Flow
----
1. Player transfers items into Blacksmith
2. Player orders experiment actions
3. Villager starts experimenting 
4. First experiment action is executed and starts the experiment progress state.  
   -Recipe to unlock is determined at this point based off the class of primary item and resources in slots
   -The amount of resources required will be a minimum X + some random unknown Y based off Recipe Skill/Crafting Skill/Structure Tier
   
5. Each experiment action completion, X resources are consumed until the min experiment reqs have been reached.  
6. After which a cummulative probability will determine if the recipe is unlocked consuming resources each time.


Crafting Redesign:

1. Quality Levels - Normal/Good/Superior/Exceptional/Masterful => Determine by crafting skill & roll
   Quality level can attempted to be improved (at the cost of durability and resources or the same class of item?)

2. Resources - Copper Ore
	       Uncommon Copper Ore
	       Rare Copper Ore

   Keep regional variants which grant 


3. Recipes - Standard - 
	   - Magical - Has limited number of use 

4. Actions - Gathering
	   - Refining
	   - Crafting
	   - Improving
	   - Enchant
	   - Transmute (maybe?)


Recipes:

1. Buy from Empire - Convert resources/items into Recipes 
2. Acquire from Experiment - Convert resources/items into Recipes
